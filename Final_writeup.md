### Project Journey
When I first started this course, I knew I wanted to do something with images cause they were a data type I had never worked with before and I was a bit initimated by them. This led me into doing research into OpenCV and different types of image classification machine learning models. I learned alot about using OpenCV but didn't end up using much of this as TensorFlow has built in image preprocessing functions that worked a bit better with my data pipeline. That being said, it gave me a much better understanding of how images are processed and used in a model which was valuable to know for this project. 

I started this project looking to build a site where a user could upload an image of a mountain and then it would predict which mountain it was. I figured I could get "50% accuracy but getting 70+ accuracy would be challenging". I initially wanted to get images from Instagram but soon found this to be infeasible as their API is very restrictive and they monitor data miners heavily. Due to this I shifted to looking into Flickr and I eventually ended up using their API. 

I first sought out to write a script to gather the data I needed. Since mountains don't exactly change or need live data, I pushed off adding a cloud function for downloading new images. I opted to write a script to download 100 images of each mountain at a time and track which page had been downloaded. This allowed me to run the program 15+ times to download about 1500 images of each mountain. 

### Data Focused
This project revolves entirely off data! Most of my time spent was spent working on mining data, preprocessing it, cleaning it, and using it for training, validating, and testing.
